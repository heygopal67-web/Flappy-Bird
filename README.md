# Flappy Runner

A small browser game where you jump over obstacles and try to survive as long as possible. Built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No build step is required.

## Features

- Clean, modern UI with start, pause and game‑over screens
- Keyboard and touch controls
- Background music with a simple mute/unmute button
- High score is saved in localStorage
- Night mode fades in after you reach a score of 10
- Obstacles use varied spacing so runs feel less repetitive

## How to play

- Start: click the Start Game button
- Jump: press Space or Arrow Up (tap on touch screens)
- Pause/Resume: press P
- Restart: press R
- Mute/Unmute: click the speaker button in the top left

Goal: avoid hitting obstacles and set a new high score.

## Getting started

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

Tip: If your browser blocks local audio, run a simple local server (for example, VS Code Live Server) and open the page from there.
